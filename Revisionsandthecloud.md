# Revisions and the Cloud
## Version Control
Version control is a system that allows you to visit different versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Version control allows you to revert to a version of a file or track changes and compare.
### Local Version Control 
Local version control stores different versions of your project/files on your disk.
### Centralized Version Control
A single server stores all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.
