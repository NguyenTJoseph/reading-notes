## Images
Adding Image
```html
<img src:"image.png" alt:"text describing image when you can't see it" tittle:"title of image typically shown when mouse hovers over"> 
```
You can add height and width attribute to the img element

When you add an image to different parts of your code it changes its placement. You can add an image in between text as well.

Three Rules:
- Save image in right format
- Save image in right size
- Measure images in pixels

JPEG
- For images with many different colors

Gif & PNG
- Saving images with few or large areas of same color
