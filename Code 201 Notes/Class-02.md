# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions
## HTML Text
HTML elements describe the structure of a web page and semantic details.
## Introduction to CSS
CSS takes HTML elements and puts it in a box and uses rules to dictate how it should look. Rules have selectors that specify the element the rule applies to and decelerations which indicate what it looks like. Decelerations have two parts: The properties and the value.
```p { font-family: Arial; }```
- Selector is "p"
- Decleration is "font-family: Arial;"
## Basic JavaScript Instructions

Creating an array:
```var colors;
colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];```
