# Forms and JS Events
## Forms
Types of forms:
- Text input
- Password Input
- Text Area
- Radio Button
- Checkboxes
- Drop-down Box
- Submit Button
- Image Button
- File Upload

You can collect information in the ```<form>`` element
- Information from form is in name/value pairs
- Forms are given a name and the value is recorded

In a list the markers can be changed with ```list-style-type``` or ```list-style-image``` to have an image as your marker.

Tables can vary by browser but you can change the border and spacing for table cells.

Styling forms make them feel more interactive and can make them easier to use if they are vertically aligned.

## Events
Events indicate when something happened (button clicked, page finished loading). Events can trigger functions. Event delegation monitors events that happens on children of an element. Most common used events are W3C DOM events.

Binding is stating the event that you are waiting for.
