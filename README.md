# Introduction
My name is Joseph, I live in Seattle and have 2 dogs. I love going out and doing things in the outdoors such as going on walks, biking, snowboarding, and being out on the water. My brother and my mother are both software developers and I have always had an affinity towards tech and am excited to pursue a career in it.

## Growth Mindset
**What is growth mindset?**
_Growth mindset_ is the belief that through work and a strong will you can develop and grow to overcome obstacles and be more adept at solving problems. This is contrasted by a _fixed mindset_ that views the ability to overcome obstacles as a trait that cannot be learned, in turn, leading to frustration and giving up.
## 3 Reminders
- [ ] Take small steps and take your time when solving problems 
- [ ] Stay focused and work through problems rather than getting distracted 
- [ ] Make a conscious effort
