## Growth Mindset
**What is growth mindset?**
_Growth mindset_ is the belief that through work and a strong will you can develop and grow to overcome obstacles and be more adept at solving problems. This is contrasted by a _fixed mindset_ that views the ability to overcome obstacles as a trait that cannot be learned, in turn, leading to frustration and giving up.
## 3 Reminders
- [ ] Take small steps and take your time when solving problems 
- [ ] Stay focused and work through problems rather than getting distracted 
- [ ] Make a conscious effort
