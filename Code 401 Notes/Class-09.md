## Dunder Methods
Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string').

Features:
- Initialization of new objects
- Object representation
- Enable iteration
- Operator overloading (comparison)
- Operator overloading (addition)
- Method invocation
- Context manager support (with statement)

## Statistics - Probability
From statistics you can derive probability.

Central Limit Theorem - Typically close to normal distribution

Three Sigma Rule - 68-95-99.7 - 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations

Z-score = Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean?
