## Random Module

```import random```
Random functions allow you to:
- Generate random numbers
- Choose a random value
- Shuffle Values
- Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

## Risk Analysis
Possible Risks
- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application

Types of Risk
- Business
- Testing
- Premature Release
- Software Risks

How to perform Risk Analysis?
1. Searching the risk
2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
3. Measures for the risk identified

Magnitude of risks: High - Medium - Low

Some risks are unavoidable

## Test Coverage
Coverage analysis helps you find the parts of the code that aren't being tested so using it can help you reduce that.

Enough testing is when...
- You rarely get bugs that escape into production
- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
