- Suffering is dependent on the story we layer on top of our pain

## Beginner's guide to Big O Notation

O(1)
- an algorithm that will always execute in the same time

O(N)
- an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

O(NÂ²)
- an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set

O(2^N)
- an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set

O(log N)
-  an algorithm whose growth curve peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
