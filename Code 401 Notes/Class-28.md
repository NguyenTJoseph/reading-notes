# Django CRUD and Forms
- Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.
- the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.
- url format: 'book/<uuid:pk>/renew/'
- CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView
```py
{% block content %}
  <h1>Renew: {{ book_instance.book.title }}</h1>
  <p>Borrower: {{ book_instance.borrower }}</p>
  <p{% if book_instance.is_overdue %} class="text-danger"{% endif %}>Due date: {{ book_instance.due_back }}</p>

  <form action="" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <table>
    {{ form.as_table }}
    </table>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
{% endblock %}
```
