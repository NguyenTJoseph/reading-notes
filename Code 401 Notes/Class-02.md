# Testing and Modules
## TDD with Python
TDD - Test-Driven Development

- TDD allows for you to think about the design fo your software by breaking it into smaller pieces
- Building to pass tests can help make your code more reliable by seeing if your tests pass after you make changes

## If Name = Main
- ```if __name__ == "__main__":```
- Executed when invoked directly
- Anything outside will be executed on import

## Recursion 
- Function calls itself directly or indirectly
- Base Case: The problem where the solution is provided
- Avoid unreachable or undefined base cases as it may cause a stack overflow
- Direct vs indirect: The function calls itself. The function calls another function that calls itself
