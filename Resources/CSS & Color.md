# CSS & Color
## CSS Summary 
- CSS takes each HTML element and contains it in a box and uses rules to dictate how it should look.
- Rules have selectors that specify the element the rule applies to and decelerations which indicate what it looks like.
- Decelerations have two parts: The properties and the value.
