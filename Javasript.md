# Javasript and Web Pages
## Progressive Enhancment
A popular way of building websites where you start with HTML then you add CSS then Javascript. Each layer of the website progressively enhancing the whole.
## Linking Javasript to HTML
``` 
<script src= "javascript file.js"></script>
```
## Object and Method
Programmers call the method of an object.
```
document.write('Good afternoon')
```
The document is the object and the method is everything else that follows.

Javascript runs where it is written in the code. It is best to have your Javascript code in a separate file but it can be incorporated.
