# How Computers Work
## 4 Things
- Input
- Storage
- Processing 
- Output

## Binary & Data
A bit is the smallest information a computer can store and is a state of on or off.

### Binary Number System
Each position is a the previous multiplied by 2 stating at 1. You take each of these bits and multiply them by the multiple of 2 and add them together.
To get the number 9:
1  0  0  1
8  4  2  1
(1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1) = 9

You can represent letters using numbers as well as images, videos, and sounds.

## Circuits 
Logic gates can be combined in a circuit to process data and give an output.

## Hardware and Software
Commands tell processors like the CPU what circuits to use. Processors take commands from storage and executes them one after another. Software converts commands into binary to allow the hardware to execute those commands. The operating systems manage how software uses hardware.
